This package aims to provide a flux conservative estimation scheme to contribute to the GeoStats.jl framework. For the very first moment it allows to remap regular, rectangular fields to regular, rectangular fields using an area weighted average. Areas can be estimated in Euclidean space as well as in spherial using Haversine distances.
